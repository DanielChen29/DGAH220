        <h1>Biblical Jungle Odyssey</h1>
        <pre>
Upon a night both vast and dire, when stormwinds howled a funeral choir,
There walked a man whose weary ire bore the weight of journeys long.
Ezekiel, the solemn monkey ranger, cast upon the earth a stranger,
Drifted far by fate’s own danger, far from lands where he belonged.

By his side in silent motion, swayed a wolf of midnight notion,
Leviathan, the serpent, coiled in ocean, whispering secrets dark and strong.
With them padded Asher’s tiger, golden-eyed and ever nigher,
Seeking paths of fate yet higher, bound to roads both cursed and long.

Through the blackened, writhing hollow, where no star dared rise nor follow,
Echoed sounds of deathly sorrow, tales of those who’d met their wrong.
Yet, upon the briny reaches, ‘neath the cliffs where madness screeches,
Stood the crumbling House of Aeetes, bound by curses deep and strong.

"Lo," spake Leviathan in voice like thunder, "In this place doth lie the wonder,
Man has sought but torn asunder, fire that turns the weak to strong."
Here the air grew thick with ether, swirling gas in spectral tether,
Mercury pools like liquid silver, dancing bright yet deadly long.

Ezekiel, with nimble, simian fingers, brushed the dust where curses linger,
Reading words in tongues that singers dared not place in sacred song.
"Fire frozen, steel yet breathing, light in stone and air deceiving,
Craft of man and god’s own grieving— this is where the path goes wrong."

Then the tiger, growling lowly, circled round the ruins slowly,
Watching shadows bending wholly, curling ‘round them all along.
From the dark there rose a figure, twisted form yet growing bigger,
Hissing, spitting, foul and bitter, speaking wrath with words prolonged.

"You who seek the forge of wonder, thief of flame that rips asunder,
Know the price of mortal plunder, knowledge deep where none belong."

Yet Ezekiel, undismayed, stood his ground and calmly prayed,
"Wisdom sought is never strayed, nor is fire forever wrong."

Then the specter, torn asunder, vanished ‘midst the rolling thunder,
And the night, in waking wonder, held its breath in silence long.
From the ruins, cold and gleaming, fire in stone began its beaming,
Ancient arts from hands once scheming, alchemy's lost and shining song.

Thus they stood, beasts and seeker, ‘fore the past both bright and bleaker,
Forged anew in truths much deeper— metals bound in bonds so strong.
As the wind cried last its warning, ‘fore the breaking light of morning,
Ezekiel left, the past still mourning, bound to walk the world ere long.
